        <h2>Overview</h2>
      
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of our rafting business is to offer customers a safe, thrilling, and memorable outdoor experience
             on the river. We aim to guide our customers through a rafting trip that challenges them, while also 
             providing them with stunning views of the river and surrounding landscape. Our trips are designed
              to cater to different skill levels, from beginners to experienced rafters, and we offer a variety 
              of trip options, including half-day, full-day, overnight, and multi-day trips.
            We believe that our rafting trips offer a unique opportunity for customers to connect with nature 
            and experience the rush of adrenaline that comes with navigating rapids. We strive to create a fun 
            and welcoming environment for all of our customers, and our team of experienced guides is dedicated 
            to ensuring their safety and enjoyment.            
            In addition to our rafting trips, we also offer equipment rental, transportation, and accommodations to 
            make our customers' experience as seamless as possible. We want our customers to leave our trips feeling 
            energized, inspired, and with a newfound appreciation for the natural world. Overall, the purpose of our 
            rafting business is to provide customers with an unforgettable adventure and promote a love of the outdoors.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Our audience is primarily composed of young and adventurous travelers who are seeking a unique and exciting 
            experience in a lesser-known destination. They value immersive and authentic experiences that allow them to 
            connect with nature and local culture. While budget-consciousness is a factor, they are willing to spend 
            money on high-quality experiences that provide value and meet their needs. They are active on social media 
            and seek out experiences that will provide shareable content and memories. By catering to the interests and 
            preferences of this audience, you can position your rafting business as a top choice for those seeking 
            adventure, immersion, and authenticity in Haiti.</p>
