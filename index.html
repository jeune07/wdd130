                Santa Fe is a province located in the central region of Argentina. It is bordered by the provinces of Chaco to the northeast, 
                Santiago del Estero to the north, Córdoba to the south, Buenos Aires to the southeast, and Entre Ríos to the east. The province's 
                capital city, also named Santa Fe, is located on the eastern shore of the Paraná River, one of the largest rivers in South America.
                 Santa Fe is known for its rich agricultural lands, producing crops such as soybeans, wheat, and maize. The province is also home 
                 to a number of historic sites, including the ruins of the Santa Fe la Vieja settlement and the Convent of San Francisco in the 
                 city of Santa Fe. Additionally, the province is a popular destination for outdoor activities such as fishing and hunting, as well 
                 as cultural events such as the National Folklore Festival.
